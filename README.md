This program shows the fundamental structure of classes as it walks through an example of a conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit. We walk through classes, subclasses, __get__, __init__, __set__, and class calls throughout this example. Classes are essential to OOP and Python as the language is fundamentally built from objects rather than functional programming.
